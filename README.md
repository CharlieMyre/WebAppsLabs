# Web Application Development Course Labs

This project hosts the labs for our Web Application Development course.

Each lab is in its own branch.

To see all branches, do:

```
git branch --list
```

To work on a particular lab, do (replacing `Lab1` with the one you want):

```
git checkout Lab1
```

Then look at the the `README.md` for that lab.
